    ...    ".0" is a jq *syntax error* (confirmed empirically: jaq parses it

    ...    exactly the bug this suite was written to catch. See suggest.rs's
    ...    `format_index`/`doc_candidates` array branch. Checked by the run
    ...    outcome rather than OCR-reading the query box itself: a bracket
    ...    vs. bare-digit query is only a couple of characters' difference,
    ...    confirmed during implementation to be too short and punctuation-
    ...    heavy for Tesseract to read reliably even when correctly
    ...    rendered -- the old bug's "Query error: query syntax error" vs.

TC-AC-012 Nested Completion Through An Accepted Key Runs Correctly
    [Documentation]    Regression test, second shape of the same bug: after
    ...    accepting an object key ("tags") and then descending into the
    ...    array it names, the separator dot typed before the index must be
    ...    dropped (not just bracket-wrapped) -- "tags.[0]" is a parse error

TC-AC-017 Whitespace After A Pipe Suppresses Auto-Open So Tab Still Indents
    [Documentation]    Regression test for the whitespace-suppression fix
    ...    (query_suggest.rs's `cursor_after_whitespace`/`QuerySuggest::
    ...    suppressed`, commit 7bb8ec2/905706b): typing a space to align or
    ...    indent a query used to still pop the keyword-dump popup open, so
    ...    the very next Tab -- pressed to keep indenting -- got eaten as
    ...    "accept suggestion" instead of inserting a tab character. "abs" is
    ...    the dump's own first alphabetical entry (also relied on by
    ...    TC-AC-050) -- with an empty word being completed (the cursor sits
    ...    right after "|", then right after the space typed after it) every
    ...    jq keyword matches equally, so the same "abs" row anchors both the
    ...    open and the suppressed state. Checked here by confirming Tab
    ...    doesn't disturb the box's focus (typing right after it still
    ...    lands, same focus-reclaim-style check TC-AC-015 uses for Escape) --
    ...    Tesseract can't distinguish an inserted tab character from
    ...    ordinary whitespace, so that part isn't OCR'd directly.

TC-AC-040 Long Candidate List Collapses With An Expandable More Row
    [Documentation]    Regression test for the Area/ScrollArea sizing bug

    ...    could get stuck there) -- the list must start collapsed to 10
    ...    rows plus a trailing "… N more" row, and clicking that row must
    ...    reveal the rest. Checked structurally (item 10 hidden, then
    ...    visible) rather than by reading the "more" text itself: confirmed
    ...    during implementation, by direct pixel inspection, that its
    ...    weak/italic style renders at roughly a third of a normal row's
    ...    brightness, which Tesseract reads as pure noise regardless of psm
    ...    mode or retries. Clicked by fixed position rather than Click

TC-AC-050 Open Bracket Offers Indices Not Keywords
    [Documentation]    Regression test: typing a lone "[" used to dump the
    ...    jq keyword table (abs, add, all, ...) -- nonsense inside an index.
    ...    people.json's root is a 3-object array, so "[" should offer
    ...    indices 0/1/2 previewed as objects. Accepting one (Enter takes
    ...    the default-selected first row) must index the root: jq reads a
    ...    bare "[0]" at the start of a query as an array *literal*, so the
    ...    accepted text has to be ".[0]". Checked by appending ".name"
    ...    (same technique as TC-AC-013, since a whole-object result is a
    ...    collapsed tree row OCR can't read a name from): ".[0].name" is
    ...    Alice, whereas the array-literal misreading "[0].name" is an
    ...    error.
