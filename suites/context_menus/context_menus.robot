Wait Until Clipboard Contains
    [Documentation]    Unlike Copy JSON Path (`ui.ctx().copy_text()` directly
    ...    on click), "Copy to Clipboard" serializes on the worker thread
    ...    first (`Command::CopyNode` / `Event::CopyReady` -- see worker.rs)
    ...    and only reaches the OS clipboard a frame or two later, so a
    ...    one-shot Get Clipboard right after the click can race it. Polls
    ...    instead.
    [Arguments]    ${expected}
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    10x    0.3s

TC-CTX-002 Menu Contents And Order On A Results Row

TC-CTX-004 Copy To Clipboard Puts The Row's Pretty JSON On The Clipboard
    [Documentation]    Right-clicking the root array's first element (Alice)
    ...    and choosing "Copy to Clipboard" should put that element's
    ...    pretty-printed JSON on the system clipboard (worker.rs's
    ...    `CopyTarget::Source` -> `serde_json::to_string_pretty`) -- not a
    ...    bare value and not the whole document. Verified via the clipboard
    ...    content itself, not the status bar's "Copied to clipboard" note:
    ...    that renders with `ui.weak()`, documented elsewhere in this suite
    ...    as unreliable for OCR.
