TC-OPEN-015 Loading A New Source Replaces The Old One And Cancels Any Query
    [Documentation]    The query *text* survives (same exception Clear makes,
    ...    see TC-OPEN-016) but its results/error are discarded, since they
    ...    belonged to the document that just got replaced. Uses the source
    ...    field for the second load, not a second paste: pasting only loads
    ...    at all while the empty-state paste box is showing (confirmed
    ...    during implementation -- once a document is loaded, that box no
    ...    longer exists to paste into, so Ctrl+V simply does nothing). The
    ...    source field has no such restriction -- it's always there and
    ...    fully functional regardless of whether a document is already
    ...    loaded, which is exactly the scenario this case is testing.

TC-OPEN-016 Clear Resets State But Preserves Query Text And Engine
    [Documentation]    Clear wipes the loaded document back to the empty
    ...    state, but the query text box and engine-picker selection survive
    ...    -- the one deliberate exception in the app's own design. Engine
    ...    selection is checked by pixel color (the selected button has a
