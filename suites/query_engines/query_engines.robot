    [Documentation]    JMESPath's "no match" evaluates to a single null

TC-QRY-002 Explicit Engine Selection Toggles On And Off
    [Documentation]    Clicking an engine button selects it (visibly

    ...    auto-detect. Checked via the button's own background pixel rather
    ...    than OCR, since the visual difference is a subtle tint, not text.
    ...    The mouse is moved away before every sample: egui shows its own
    ...    subtle hover tint on a widget the cursor is merely resting over
    ...    (confirmed during implementation -- a click leaves the cursor
    ...    sitting on the button afterward, and comparing a hovered-but-
    ...    unselected sample against a never-hovered baseline can read as a

TC-QRY-013 Auto-Detect JMESPath Filter Marker Routes To JMESPath
    [Documentation]    No leading marker distinguishes JMESPath from jq, so

TC-QRY-014 Auto-Detect Bare Identifier Falls Back To Jq
    [Documentation]    A bare word with none of the other engines' markers is
    ...    ambiguous, so detection defaults to jq -- the richer, originally
    ...    default dialect (even though this particular one is invalid jq and
    ...    errors, the point is which engine it was routed to). Checked by
    ...    ruling out the other three engine names rather than asserting "jq"
    ...    itself is present -- confirmed during implementation that
    ...    Tesseract sometimes misreads the 2-character "jq" label as "iq" at
    ...    this size, which a positive check for the literal text "jq" is
    ...    flaky against.

TC-QRY-020 Jq Per-Item Errors Are Non-Fatal
    [Documentation]    One item failing (e.g. dividing by an object) doesn't
    ...    abort the whole run -- the other items' errors are just counted
    ...    and the last one's message shown, and the query still "finishes".
    ...    "0 result(s)" is checked as plain "result(s)": the leading digit 0
    ...    is confirmed flaky against Tesseract's own O/0 confusion at this
    ...    font size (the same class of issue as "jq" vs "iq" above), and the
    ...    real point of this case is carried by the query finishing at all

TC-QRY-024 Jq Field Projection Streams One Result Per Item
    [Documentation]    A different field than the other jq cases (.role, not

TC-QRY-025 Jq Length Reduces The Whole Array To One Scalar Result

    [Documentation]    A multi-stage pipeline (sort_by, then array indexing)
