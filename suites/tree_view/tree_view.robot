Documentation     Tree view rendering and interaction -- see
...               docs/05_tree_view.md. TC-TREE-006 (highlight +
...               centered scroll on reveal) is exercised by the search
...               suite's TC-SRCH-020 instead of duplicated here (same
...               underlying `TreeView::reveal`, cross-ref only). TC-TREE-004
...               (streamed results preserve expand state) needs catching a
...               query mid-stream, which is too timing-dependent to assert
...               reliably against real wall-clock query latency -- not
...               implemented.

TC-TREE-001 Each Value Kind Renders With Its Own Color And Text Shape
    [Documentation]    string/number/bool/null/array/object each get distinct
    ...    treatment -- checked both by OCR'd text shape (quoted string,
    ...    bare number/bool/null, "(N keys)"/"(N items)" containers) and by
    ...    pixel color contrast between the scalar kinds, since color is the
    ...    one part OCR can't read directly.

TC-TREE-005 Scrolling A Long List Reveals Rows Outside The Initial Viewport
    [Documentation]    A 200-element array is far more rows than fit in the
    ...    panel at once -- confirms the tree actually scrolls (rather than,
    ...    say, silently capping what it draws) by checking a near-the-end
    ...    element is absent before scrolling and present once scrolled all
    ...    the way down. Targets row 197 rather than the true last row (199):
    ...    confirmed during implementation that scrolling this list to its
    ...    max still leaves 198/199 clipped by a few pixels at the very
    ...    bottom of the panel, too little of either row for OCR to read --
    ...    197 is the last row that scrolls fully into view. Targets a fixed
    ...    row near the end (rather than some point further up the middle)
    ...    so "scroll repeatedly until scrolling stops helping" is an
    ...    unambiguous stopping condition -- a target further from the end
    ...    risks a single large scroll step jumping clean over the one
    ...    viewport where it would have been visible, between two of this
    ...    loop's checks.
